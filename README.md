<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
The National Association of the Deaf has recorded India as the home to the largest deaf community in the world with 18 million deaf individuals and around 63 million individuals with severe hearing impairments. Despite the large population of people with hearing loss, the lack of recognition of the Indian Sign Language (ISL) greatly hampers accessibility, inclusivity and contributes to a significant communication barrier.

With only 250 registered ISL interpreters and a complete absence of accessible tools to translate or learn Indian Sign Language (ISL), it hinders the audibly impaired community's ability to fully participate in social, educational and professional environments, leading to feelings of isolation, dependency. The unavailability of sufficient resource , educational and employment opportunities for ISL users further exacerbates this issue.

<h2>Solution</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ishaara aims to develop a comprehensive platform for the community to facilitate translation between text, speech and Indian Sign Language, among English and 107 different foreign languages. </li>
  <li>The main objective of Ishaara is to help the deaf and dumb community in India, who communicate through Indian Sign Language or ISL, be able to connect and communicate with any person present in any part of the world by providing an AI-based interpreter tool to promote two-way communication between the ISL and non-ISL users.</li>
  <li>This initiative aims to enhance inclusion, improve accessibility, and preserve ISL as a cultural heritage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Social Impact:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Promotes equality for all sections</li>
  <li>Improves social life</li>
  <li>Increases chances of employment</li>
</ul>

<h2>UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)</h2>
Ishaara comes in line with UN SDG-10 i.e. <strong>Reduced Inequalities.</strong>

<h2>Components</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Text to ISL</li>
  <li>Audio to ISL</li>
  <li>ISL to text and audio</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technology Stack</h2>
<ul>
<p><strong>Frontend: </strong>HTML, CSS, JS</p>
<p><strong>Backend: </strong>Python and Flask</p>
</ul>

<h2>Our Contributions</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Video Recording:</strong></li>
  <p>Due to the unavailability of suitable number of videos showcasing the ISL gesture for words, the team recorded a total of 360 videos for 17 words and performed data augmentation on them to increase the videos to a total of 5960 videos (360 filmed, 5400 augmented)</li></p>
  <li><strong>Feature Extraction: </strong></li>
  <p>Invented our own innovative AI-algorithm to extract features from the videos using Computer Vision Techniques.</p>
  <li><strong>Dataset Creation:</strong></li>
  <p>The features extracted for each video were stored in a .npy file. All the .npy files were later merged into a single pandas dataframe.</p>
  <li><strong>Model: </strong></li>
  <p>Ishaara model, built on LSTMs to convert ISL to text, was trained on the dataset created that resulted in an accuracy of <strong>85%.</strong></p>
</ol>

<h2>Copyright: </h2>
The dataset and the ISL to text component have been copyrighted <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UxkPLgEoQTNQPjQvbTSvpsSp2fkBwIlM?usp=drive_link">here </a>under the <strong>Indian Copyright Act.</strong>

<h2>Ethical Considerations of AI</h2>
Ishaara uses AI ethically as:
<ul>
  <li>No personal data is taken from the user.</li>
  <li>The text, audio and video input given by the user are not being stored anywhere.</li>
  <li>The model has been trained on our own copyrighted dataset.</li>
</ul>
Hence, Ishaara is safe and secure to use and treats all users equally.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Innovation: </strong>Ishaara stands out as an innovation by filling the technological and societal gap for a tool to translate ISL to text and vice versa.</li>
  <li><strong>Feasibility: </strong>Building Ishaara has proved that it is feasible to have an AI-based interpreter which is user-friendly.</li>
  <li><strong>Interpreter Independence: </strong>Havign an AI-based interpreter makes ISL users fairly independent in life and need not worry about the presence of an interpreter everywhere.</li>
  <li><strong>Affordable: </strong>Ishaara is affordable as well as accessible as its just a web-based platform that can be used anytime, anywhere and by anyone</li>
  <li><strong>Social Impact: </strong>Ishaara has a significant social impact by boosting the confidence of individuals who use ISL, opening new avenues for them to interact in all sections of society.</li>
  <li><strong>Contribution: </strong>Ishaara contributes globally by exhibiting inclusivity for the differently abled of the society, hence uniting people.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Today, Ishaara shines a light for those who use Indian Sign Language, and tomorrow, it can help everyone, no matter the sign language. Together, we can make it possible and bring the world closer together.</strong>
